For the following dataset:
x1 = c(12,8,9,9,11,9,8,11,10,11);
x2 = c(4,7,5,6,4,6,7,5,5,4);
x3 = c(1,4,3,3,1,2,4,1,2,1);
Tasks
1. Calculate the Pearson correlation between x1 and x2, x1 and x3, as well as x2 and x3. Which pair has the
highest correlation? 
2. Create a ranked version of each vector.
3. Compare the Pearson and Spearman correlations between all vectors. 
4. Estimate the covariance matrix for (x1, x2, x3). Note: This matrix should be 3 by 3. 
5. Using the covariance matrix, estimate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
6. Plot a scatter plot of x1 against x2, including the respective principal vectors.
